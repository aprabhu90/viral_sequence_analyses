# Insights into phylogeny, diversity, and functional potential of Poseidoniales viruses 

These R scripts have been designed for 

1. Work with iPHoP (integrated Phage-Host Prediction) results for analyzing virus-host assignments
2. Evaluate orthologous fractions for grouping of viruses into clusters using predicted proteins
3. Perform co-ocurrence analyses to observe correlations between viruses and their host.
